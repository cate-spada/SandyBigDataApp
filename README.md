# SandyBigDataApp

The following project was realised as a project for the course Modelling and Techniques for Big Data delivered as part of the bachelor's degree course in computer engineering.

Description:

This repository hosts a big data application designed for conducting aggregated queries on a dataset containing detailed information about Hurricane Sandy.

Features:
- Apache Spark Integration: Utilizes Apache Spark to execute complex queries efficiently, leveraging its distributed computing capabilities to process vast amounts of data.
- Angular User Interface: Presents a user-friendly interface developed in Angular, facilitating seamless user interaction and intuitive visualization of query results.
- Flask Backend Integration: Includes the integration of a Flask backend, enhancing the application's functionality by providing robust API endpoints and managing data flow between the user interface and Apache Spark processing.
- Advanced Analysis Algorithms (Machine Learning): Employs advanced analysis algorithms, including machine learning models, for in-depth data exploration and predictive analytics beyond basic query execution.
